# Hero Game
Following an internship to improve my level in Python, I created this little game. The principle is simple:

You are a character who must collect as many coins as possible in 60 seconds.

## Features:
- You can move with the arrow keys as well as with ZQSD (I will release the WASD version soon)
- The best score is saved in score.txt
- New modes will be added soon

## Play
- Once the code has been launched (see **[Installing the code](https://github.com/ShamuCode/hero-game/edit/main/README.md#installing-the-code)**, use the arrow keys or the ZQSD keys on the keyboard to collect the coins.

## Installing the code
- Install Python at https://www.python.org/
- Install Visual Studio Code (recommended) at https://code.visualstudio.com/

- Unzip the folder
- Open the folder in a code editor (preferably VSCode)
- In the console type
```python
pip install pygame
```
```python
pip install os
```
```python
pip install pillow
```

- To run the code, click the start button in the editor or type the following texte in the console
```python
python game.py
```
